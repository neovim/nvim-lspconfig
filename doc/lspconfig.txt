INTRODUCTION                                                         *lspconfig*

nvim-lspconfig is a collection of community-contributed configurations for the
Nvim LSP client. See |lspconfig-all| for the complete list of provided
configurations.

Note: nvim-lspconfig is just a convenience layer, it is NOT required for Nvim
|LSP| support. See |lsp-quickstart| to setup LSP without nvim-lspconfig.

==============================================================================
QUICKSTART                                                *lspconfig-quickstart*

1. Install a language server, e.g. pyright. >
   npm i -g pyright
2. Add the language server setup to your init.lua. >
   require'lspconfig'.pyright.setup{}
3. Ensure your project/workspace contains a root marker which matches the
   server requirements specified in |lspconfig-all|.
4. Open a code file in Nvim. LSP will attach and provide diagnostics. >
   nvim main.py
5. Run `:checkhealth lsp` to see the status or to troubleshoot.

==============================================================================
THE SETUP METHOD                                               *lspconfig-setup*

`lspconfig` consists of a collection of language server configurations. Each
configuration exposes a `setup {}` metamethod which makes it easy to directly
use the default configuration or selectively override the defaults. 
`setup {}` is the primary interface by which users interact with `lspconfig`.

Using the default configuration for a server is simple:
>
    require'lspconfig'.clangd.setup{}
<
The available server names listed in |lspconfig-all| match the
`config.SERVER_NAME` defined in each configuration's source file.

`setup{}` wraps |vim.lsp.start_client()| or |vim.lsp.buf_attach_client()|
functions (depending on whether the current file belongs to a project with
a currently running client; see |lspconfig-root-detection|).

`setup{}` takes a superset of the keys listed in |vim.lsp.start_client()| with
the following added keys:

- {root_dir} (`function(filename, bufnr)`) Returns either a filepath (string)
  or nil. The language server will only start if the function returns
  a filepath.

  If a root directory (string) is returned which is unique from any previously
  returned root_dir, a new server will be spawned with that root directory.
  See |lspconfig-root-detection| for more details

- {name} (`string`) Defaults to the server's name (`clangd`, `pyright`, etc.).

- {filetypes} (`list[string] | nil`) Set of filetypes for which to attempt to
  resolve {root_dir}. May be empty, or server may specify a default value.

- {autostart} (`bool`) (default: true) Controls if the `FileType` autocommand
  that launches a language server is created. If `false`, allows for deferring
  language servers until manually launched with `:LspStart`.

- {single_file_support} (`bool`) (default: nil) Determines if a server is
  started without a matching root directory. See |lspconfig-single-file-support|.

- {on_new_config} (`function(new_config, new_root_dir)`) Function executed
  after a root directory is detected. This is used to modify the server
  configuration (including `cmd` itself). Most commonly, this is used to
  inject additional arguments into `cmd`.

  If overriding `on_new_config`, ensure that you read the `on_new_config`
  defined in the source file of the default configuration in `lspconfig`. The
  original `on_new_config` snippet for a given server should likely be
  included in your new override. Some configurations use `on_new_config` to
  dynamically set or modify `cmd`.

Note: all entries passed to `setup {}` override the entry in the default
configuration. There is no composition.

All `config` elements described in `:help vim.lsp.start_client()` can
additionally be overridden via the `setup {}` call. The most commonly
passed overrides to `setup {}` are:

- {settings} `table <string, string|table|bool>`

  The `settings` table is sent after initialization via a
  `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification from the Nvim client to
  the language server. These settings allow a user to change optional runtime
  settings of the language server. 

  As an example, to set the following settings found in the pyright
  documentation:

  `pyright.disableLanguageServices`: `boolean`
  `pyright.disableOrganizeImports`: `boolean`

  Nested keys need to be translated into a nested table and passed to
  the settings field in `setup {}` as follows:
>
  require('lspconfig').pyright.setup{
    settings = {
      pyright = {
          disableLanguageServices = true,
          disableOrganizeImports  = true,
        }
    }
  }

==============================================================================
OVERRIDING GLOBAL DEFAULTS                           *lspconfig-global-defaults*

WARNING: This API is deprecated. Use |LspAttach| from Nvim core instead.

The global defaults for all servers can be overridden by extending the
`default_config` table.

>
  local lspconfig = require'lspconfig'
  lspconfig.util.default_config = vim.tbl_extend(
    "force",
    lspconfig.util.default_config,
    {
      autostart = false,
      handlers = {
        ["window/logMessage"] = function(err, method, params, client_id)
            if params and params.type <= vim.lsp.protocol.MessageType.Log then
              vim.lsp.handlers["window/logMessage"](err, method, params, client_id)
            end
          end,
        ["window/showMessage"] = function(err, method, params, client_id)
            if params and params.type <= vim.lsp.protocol.MessageType.Warning.Error then
              vim.lsp.handlers["window/showMessage"](err, method, params, client_id)
            end
          end,
      }
    }
  )
<
`setup {}` can additionally override these defaults in subsequent calls.

==============================================================================
SETUP HOOK                                                *lspconfig-setup-hook*

WARNING: This API is deprecated. Use |LspAttach| from Nvim core instead.

`lspconfig` will execute the `on_setup` hook for each setup call to a server after
validating its configuration, and before attempting to launch the server
itself. One typical usage is to allow ad-hoc substitution for any
configuration entry, such as `cmd`.

>
  local lspconfig = require 'lspconfig'
  lspconfig.util.on_setup = lspconfig.util.add_hook_before(lspconfig.util.on_setup, function(config)
    if some_condition and config.name == "clangd" then
      local custom_server_prefix = "/my/custom/server/prefix"
      config.cmd = { custom_server_prefix .. "/bin/clangd" }
    end
  end)


Note: This is primarily targeted at plugins developers, so make sure to use
`util.add_hook_before()` as a wrapper instead of overriding the original function
completely, to void breaking external integrations with lspconfig.

==============================================================================
SERVER CONFIGS                                        *lspconfig-configurations*

See |lspconfig-all| for the list of provided LSP configurations.

For servers for which there is not a configuration, it is necessary to define
a configuration. This can be done through the `configs` module.

The `configs` module is a singleton where configs are defined. The
`vim.validate` schema is: >

    configs.SERVER_NAME = {
      default_config = {'t'},
      on_new_config = {'f', true},
      on_attach = {'f', true},
      commands = {'t', true},
      docs = {'t', true},
    }
<
where the structure of `docs` is: >

    docs = {
      description = {'s', true},
      default_config = {'t', true},
    }
<
`commands` is a map of `name:definition` key:value pairs, where `definition`
is a list whose first value is a function implementing the command, and the
rest are either array values which will be formed into flags for the command,
or special keys like `description`.

WARNING: Commands is deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
It is recommended to use `vim.api.nvim_create_user_command()` instead in an
|LspAttach| autocommand handler.

Example:
>
  local function organize_imports()
    local params = {
      command = 'pyright.organizeimports',
      arguments = { vim.uri_from_bufnr(0) },
    }
    vim.lsp.buf.execute_command(params)
  end

  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('LspAttach', {
    callback = function(ev)
      local client = vim.lsp.get_client_by_id(ev.data.client_id)
      if client.name == "pyright" then
        vim.api.nvim_create_user_command("PyrightOrganizeImports", organize_imports, {desc = 'Organize Imports'})
      end
    end
  end

  require("lspconfig")['pyright'].setup{}
<

The `configs.__newindex` metamethod consumes the config definition and returns
an object with a `setup()` method, to be invoked by users:
>
    require'lspconfig'.SERVER_NAME.setup{}

After you set `configs.SERVER_NAME` you can add arbitrary language-specific
functions to it if necessary.

Example:
>
    configs.texlab.buf_build = buf_build
<

==============================================================================
ADDING NEW SERVERS                                    *lspconfig-new*

The steps for adding and enabling a new server configuration are:

1. Define the configuration (see also |vim.fs.root()|): >lua
   local lspconfig = require 'lspconfig'
   local configs = require 'lspconfig.configs'

   -- Check if the config is already defined (useful when reloading this file)
   if not configs.foo_lsp then
     configs.foo_lsp = {
       default_config = {
         cmd = {'/home/neovim/lua-language-server/run.sh'},
         filetypes = {'lua'},
         root_dir = function(fname)
           return lspconfig.util.find_git_ancestor(fname)
         end,
         settings = {},
       },
     }
   end

2. Call `setup()` to enable the FileType autocmd >
   lspconfig.foo_lsp.setup{}
<
==============================================================================
ROOT DETECTION                                        *lspconfig-root-detection*
                                                            *lspconfig-root-dir*

WARNING: This API is deprecated. Use |vim.fs| from Nvim core instead.

A project's `root_dir` is used by `lspconfig` to determine whether `lspconfig`
should start a new server, or attach a previous one, to the current file.

`lspconfig` automatically launches language servers by defining a filetype
autocommand based on the `filetypes` specified in the default configuration of
each server, optionally overridable by the `filetypes` table passed to
`setup`.

This autocommand triggers a search from the current file position in the
filesystem hierarchy up to the top level directory of your filesystem. The
`root_dir` entry of each configuration is a function that returns true if the
current directory in this traversal matches a given root pattern.

The following utility functions are provided by `lspconfig`. Each function call
below returns a function that takes as its argument the current buffer path.

- `util.root_pattern`: function which takes multiple arguments, each 
  corresponding to a different root pattern against which the contents of the
  current directory are matched using |vim.fn.glob()| while traversing up the
  filesystem. Parent directories are traversed once per pattern, in the order
  the patterns are specified. >
   root_dir = util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'requirements.txt')
- `util.find_git_ancestor`: a function that locates the first parent directory
  containing a `.git` directory. >
   root_dir = util.find_git_ancestor
- `util.find_node_modules_ancestor`: a function that locates the first parent
  directory containing a `node_modules` directory. >
   root_dir = util.find_node_modules_ancestor
- `util.find_package_json_ancestor`: a function that locates the first parent
  directory containing a `package.json`. >
   root_dir = util.find_package_json_ancestor
<
Note: On Windows, `lspconfig` always assumes forward slash normalized paths with
capitalized drive letters.

==============================================================================
ADVANCED ROOT DIRECTORY DETECTION                      *lspconfig-root-advanced* 
                                                    *lspconfig-root-composition*

WARNING: This API is deprecated. Use |vim.fs| from Nvim core instead.

The `root_dir` key in `config` and `setup` can hold any function of the form
>
  function custom_root_dir(filename, bufnr)
  returns nil | string
>
This allows for rich composition of root directory patterns which is necessary
for some project structures. Example (for Kotlin):
>
  local root_files = {
    'settings.gradle', -- Gradle (multi-project)
    'settings.gradle.kts', -- Gradle (multi-project)
    'build.xml', -- Ant
    'pom.xml', -- Maven
  }

  local fallback_root_files = {
    'build.gradle', -- Gradle
    'build.gradle.kts', -- Gradle
  }
  root_dir = function(fname)
    local primary = util.root_pattern(unpack(root_files))(fname)
    local fallback = util.root_pattern(unpack(fallback_root_files))(fname)
    return primary or fallback
  end
<
Browsing the source of the default configurations is recommended.

==============================================================================
SINGLE FILE SUPPORT                              *lspconfig-single-file-support*

Language servers require each project to have a `root` in order to provide
features that require cross-file indexing. 

Some servers support not passing a root directory as a proxy for single file
mode under which cross-file features may be degraded.

`lspconfig` offers limited support for an implicit single-file mode by:

- first trying to resolve the root directory pattern
- then, if `single_file_support` is enabled for a given language server
  configuration, starting the server without sending `rootDirectory` or
  `workspaceFolders` during initialization.
- attaching subsequent files in the parent directory to the same server
  instance, depending on filetype.
- also supports unnamed buffer if filetype matches the server filetype
  settings.

Cross-file features (navigation, hover) may or may not work depending on the
language server. For a full feature-set, consider moving your files to a
directory with a project structure `lspconfig` can infer.

Note that in the event that the LSP specification is extended to support a
standard for single-file mode, lspconfig will adopt that standard.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                    *lspconfig-commands*

- `:LspInfo` shows the status of active and configured language servers. Note
  that client id refers to the Nvim RPC instance connected to a given
  language server. Also shows a list of deprecated servers that have been
  configured.

The following commands support tab-completion for all arguments. All commands
that require a client id can either leverage tab-completion or the info
contained in `:LspInfo`:

- `:LspStart <config_name>` launches the requested (configured) client, but only
  if it successfully resolves a root directory. Note: Defaults to all
  configured servers matching the current buffer filetype.
- `:LspStop <client_id>` stops the server with the given client id. Defaults to
  stopping all servers active on the current buffer. if you want to force stop
  a language server you can do it like `:LspStop <client_id> ++force`
- `:LspRestart <client_id>` restarts the client with the given client id, and
  will attempt to reattach to all previously attached buffers.

==============================================================================
COMPLETION SUPPORT                                        *lspconfig-completion*

See |lsp-config|.

==============================================================================
DEBUGGING AND TROUBLESHOOTING                              *lspconfig-debugging*

While using language servers should be easy, debugging issues can be
challenging. First, it is important to identify the source of the issue, which
is typically (in rough order):

- the language server itself
- a plugin
- overrides in a user configuration
- the built-in client in Nvim core
- nvim-lspconfig

The first step in debugging is to test with a minimal configuration:
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Clsp&template=lsp_bug_report.yml(such as
Historically, many problems are due to plugins or misconfiguration.

Should that fail, identifying which component is the culprit is challenging.
The following are the only categories of bugs that pertain to nvim-lspconfig.

- The root directory inferred for your project is wrong, or it should be
  detected but is not due to a bug in the nvim-lspconfig path utilities.
- The server is launching, but you believe that the default settings,
  initialization options, or command arguments are suboptimal and should be
  replaced based on your understanding of the server documentation.

All bugs Nvim's built-in client should be reported to the Nvim core issue
tracker. All bugs pertaining to plugins should be reported to the respective
plugin. All missing features in a language server should be reported to the
upstream language server issue tracker.

For debugging nvim-lspconfig issues, the most common hurdles users face are:

  - The language server is not installed or is otherwise not executable.
    nvim-lspconfig does not install language servers for you. Ensure the `cmd`
    defined in |lspconfig-all| is executable from the command line. If the
    absolute path to the binary is not supplied in `cmd`, ensure it is on your
    PATH.
  - Missing filetype plugins. Certain languages are not detecting by
    Vim/Nvim because they have not yet been added to the filetype detection
    system. Ensure `:set ft?` shows the filetype and not an empty value.
  - Not triggering root detection. nvim-lspconfig is built around the concept of projects. See
    |lspconfig-root-detection| for more details. Most of the time,
    initializing a git repo will suffice.
  - Not triggering root detection. Some language servers will only start
    if it is opened in a directory, or child directory, containing a file
    which signals the *root* of the project. Most of the time, this is
    a `.git` folder, but each server defines the root config in the lua file.
    See |lspconfig-all| or the source code for the list of root directories.
  - Misconfiguration. Often users will override `cmd`, `on_init`, or
    `handlers`. Ensure that you debug by using a stock configuration to ensure
    your customizations are not introducing issues.

|LspInfo| provides an overview of your active and configured language servers
which can be useful for debugging.

Note that it will not report any configuration changes applied in
`on_new_config`.

==============================================================================
LOGGING                                                      *lspconfig-logging*

When debugging language servers, it is helpful to enable additional logging in
the built-in client, specifically considering the RPC logs. Example:
>
  vim.lsp.set_log_level 'trace'
  if vim.fn.has 'nvim-0.5.1' == 1 then
    require('vim.lsp.log').set_format_func(vim.inspect)
  end
<
Attempt to run the language server, and open the log with:

>
    :LspLog
<
Note that `ERROR` messages containing `stderr` only indicate that the log was
sent to `stderr`. Many servers counter-intuitively send harmless messages
via stderr.

==============================================================================
SCOPE                                                         *lspconfig-scope*

`lspconfig` is a community effort to create default configurations that fit
within the scope of an official plugin for Nvim. All features that are not
strictly providing default configurations for language servers will be removed
from `lspconfig` in time.

==============================================================================
Highlights                                                *lspconfig-highlight*

LspInfoTitle        Client name
LspInfoList         Server name list
LspInfoFiletype     `filetypes` area
LspInfoTip          Tip
LspInfoBorder       Window border
    To set the border use: >
        require('lspconfig.ui.windows').default_options.border = 'single'
<    Accepts the same values as the `border` option to |nvim_open_win()|
