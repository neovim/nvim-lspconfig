---
--- Lua language server.
---
--- `lua-language-server` can be installed by following the instructions [here](https://luals.github.io/#neovim-install).
---
--- The default `cmd` assumes that the `lua-language-server` binary can be found in `$PATH`.
---
--- If you primarily use `lua-language-server` for Neovim, and want to provide completions,
--- analysis, and location handling for plugins on runtime path, you can use the following
--- settings.
---
--- ```lua
--- vim.lsp.config('lua_ls', {
---   on_init = function(client)
---     if client.workspace_folders then
---       local path = client.workspace_folders[1].name
---       if
---         path ~= vim.fn.stdpath('config')
---         and (vim.uv.fs_stat(path .. '/.luarc.json') or vim.uv.fs_stat(path .. '/.luarc.jsonc'))
---       then
---         return
---       end
---     end
---
---     client.config.settings.Lua = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', client.config.settings.Lua, {
---       runtime = {
---         -- Tell the language server which version of Lua you're using (most
---         -- likely LuaJIT in the case of Neovim)
---         version = 'LuaJIT',
---         -- Tell the language server how to find Lua modules same way as Neovim
---         -- (see `:h lua-module-load`)
---         path = {
---           'lua/?.lua',
---           'lua/?/init.lua',
---         },
---       },
---       -- Make the server aware of Neovim runtime files
---       workspace = {
---         checkThirdParty = false,
---         library = {
---           vim.env.VIMRUNTIME
---           -- Depending on the usage, you might want to add additional paths
---           -- here.
---           -- '${3rd}/luv/library'
---           -- '${3rd}/busted/library'
---         }
---         -- Or pull in all of 'runtimepath'.
---         -- NOTE: this is a lot slower and will cause issues when working on
---         -- your own configuration.
---         -- See https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/3189
---         -- library = {
---         --   vim.api.nvim_get_runtime_file('', true),
---         -- }
---       }
---     })
---   end,
---   settings = {
---     Lua = {}
---   }
--- })
--- ```
