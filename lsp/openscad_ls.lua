--
-- A Language Server Protocol server for OpenSCAD
--
-- You can build and install `openscad-language-server` binary with `cargo`:
-- ```sh
-- cargo install openscad-language-server
-- ```
--
-- Vim does not have built-in syntax for the `openscad` filetype currently.
--
-- This can be added via an autocmd:
--
-- ```lua
-- vim.cmd [[ autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.scad set filetype=openscad ]]
-- ```
--
-- or by installing a filetype plugin such as https://github.com/sirtaj/vim-openscad
return {
  cmd = { 'openscad-language-server' },
  filetypes = { 'openscad' },
  root_markers = { '.git' },
}
