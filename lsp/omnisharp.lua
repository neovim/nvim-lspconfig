-- OmniSharp server based on Roslyn workspaces
--
-- `omnisharp-roslyn` can be installed by downloading and extracting a release from [here](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases).
-- OmniSharp can also be built from source by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/omnisharp/omnisharp-roslyn#downloading-omnisharp).
--
-- OmniSharp requires the [dotnet-sdk](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to be installed.
--
-- **By default, omnisharp-roslyn doesn't have a `cmd` set.** This is because nvim-lspconfig does not make assumptions about your path. You must add the following to your init.vim or init.lua to set `cmd` to the absolute path ($HOME and ~ are not expanded) of the unzipped run script or binary.
--
-- For `go_to_definition` to work fully, extended `textDocument/definition` handler is needed, for example see [omnisharp-extended-lsp.nvim](https://github.com/Hoffs/omnisharp-extended-lsp.nvim)
