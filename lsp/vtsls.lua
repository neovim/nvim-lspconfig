---
--- `vtsls` can be installed with npm:
--- ```sh
--- npm install -g @vtsls/language-server
--- ```
---
--- To configure a TypeScript project, add a
--- [`tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)
--- or [`jsconfig.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig) to
--- the root of your project.
---
--- ### Vue support
---
--- Since v3.0.0, the Vue language server requires `vtsls` to support TypeScript.
---
--- ```
--- -- If you are using mason.nvim, you can get the ts_plugin_path like this
--- -- For Mason v1,
--- -- local mason_registry = require('mason-registry')
--- -- local vue_language_server_path = mason_registry.get_package('vue-language-server'):get_install_path() .. '/node_modules/@vue/language-server'
--- -- For Mason v2,
--- -- local vue_language_server_path = vim.fn.expand '$MASON/packages' .. '/vue-language-server' .. '/node_modules/@vue/language-server'
--- -- or even
--- -- local vue_language_server_path = vim.fn.stdpath('data') .. "/mason/packages/vue-language-server/node_modules/@vue/language-server"
--- local vue_language_server_path = '/path/to/@vue/language-server'
--- local vue_plugin = {
---   name = '@vue/typescript-plugin',
---   location = vue_language_server_path,
---   languages = { 'vue' },
---   configNamespace = 'typescript',
--- }
--- vim.lsp.config('vtsls', {
---   settings = {
---     vtsls = {
---       tsserver = {
---         globalPlugins = {
---           vue_plugin,
---         },
---       },
---     },
---   },
---   filetypes = { 'typescript', 'javascript', 'javascriptreact', 'typescriptreact', 'vue' },
--- })
--- ```
---
--- - `location` MUST be defined. If the plugin is installed in `node_modules`, `location` can have any value.
--- - `languages` must include vue even if it is listed in filetypes.
--- - `filetypes` is extended here to include Vue SFC.
---
--- You must make sure the Vue language server is setup. For example,
---
--- ```
--- vim.lsp.enable('vue_ls')
--- ```
---
--- See `vue_ls` section and https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/wiki/Neovim for more information.
---
--- ### Monorepo support
---
--- `vtsls` supports monorepos by default. It will automatically find the `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` corresponding to the package you are working on.
--- This works without the need of spawning multiple instances of `vtsls`, saving memory.
---
--- It is recommended to use the same version of TypeScript in all packages, and therefore have it available in your workspace root. The location of the TypeScript binary will be determined automatically, but only once.
